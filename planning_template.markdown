# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?
* Why is this a “challenge”?
* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?
* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?
* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?
* Was it effective? How do you know?
* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?
* What will be the next three things you do?
* How will you keep track of progress and results?
* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

## The Future

* What would total success look like?
* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?
* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
* How feasible are each of those goals?

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?
* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?
* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?
* Which other challenges does this align with?
* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?
* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

1. We need to minimize the time between when an applicant submits their application and when they receive a decision.
2. We need to find the applicants who possess the academic potential and characteristics necessary for community building and success in the program.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

1. Because we want to be able to fill the cohorts with outstanding people, and to reduce the possibility that some of the applicants decide other programs instead of ours.
2. Because we want to have the best people, and this means, having the best applicants, the best students, and the best developers.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Yes this can be solved. Solving these would enhance our community by growing it with outstanding people.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We won't be able to have the best students and graduates, hurting our brand, and the program outcome in the mid-term.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

This is my direct responsibility. Also, my previous position as Director of Admissions allowed me to be close to this issue.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

1. We have established a process with clear responsibilities that allows us to keep track of the applicants as they come through our system.
2. We have implemented a pretty standardize way and an informal training for new interviewers.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

1. Yes, but it's shortcomings are evident.
2. Yes, but it needs to be documented.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

No.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

1. We are already working to automate most of our interactions with applicants.
2. We are going to start documenting the interview process and create some guiding questions that can be used by the interviewers.

* What will be the next three things you do?

1. First Challenge
  1. Identify the areas to be automated (done).
  2. Automate those tasks (doing).
  3. Work on the email wording.
2. Second Challenge
  1. Implement a manual for interviewers that compiles the best practices from the interviewers and the sample questions.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

By having biweekly meetings with Josh Mejia regarding our progress on the software side, and having meetings with the operations team every week.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

1. The time that we spend on boring and repetitive tasks will be reduce to almost zero.
2. The interviewers will be more consistent in their assessments.
3. We will have full cohorts of outstanding and diverse individuals.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

1. Amount of time that passes between application submission and decision.
2. Number of students per cohort.
3. Number of underrepresented students per cohort.
4. Number of dropouts per cohort.
5. Number of expelled students per cohort.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

1. Time that passes between submission and decision is no longer than a week.
2. Each cohort is filled with 20 or more students.
3. Each cohort has at least 10 underrepresented students.
4. Each cohort has no dropouts.
5. Each cohort has no expelled students.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

They are within reach.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

We are already working in this. The new structure and software developments would allow us to accomplish this as long as everyone in the organization moves forward.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I need to be in constant communication with the software, operations and admissions teams to improve our processes and fix errors.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

The support of the software, operations and admissions teams.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

The other student-lifecycle challenges, and some of the software challenges (enroll & apply).

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

The software, operations and admissions teams.

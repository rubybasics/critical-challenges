# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

1. We need the Enroll app to minimize labor for the staff and shorten the time-to-enrollment period for students.
2. We need the Enroll app to provide metrics and reports to keep the operations team informed.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

1. So far, the operations staff is doing many things manually that can be automated. Also, the app should allow the non-technical staff to modify the data easily without the need of a developer.
2. We have very limited reporting in terms of payments and enrollment status, and this limits our ability to respond quickly or track the state of the students accurately.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

1. Yes. If this were to be solved, we would save enormous amounts of time that would otherwise be spent on boring and repetitive tasks.
2. Yes. Having better records will allow us to keep better track without having to dig into a stack of papers and emails every time we need to solve or verify the status of a student.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

1. We would be slower by the minute, and we would not be able to respond to new organizational challenges.
2. Our records would keep diverging to the point that they won't matter anymore.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

1. I work with the operations team to assess the business needs.
2. Idem.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

Josh Mejia and I planned the first biweekly sprint last Friday, and we expect that the system will allow us to gather the business needs, allow the software team to work on it and be able to have a more organized approach to solving our software problems.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

I has been a considerable improvement so far. We will be able to better assess our progress next week Friday.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Sort of. It was assigned to Josh Cheek but I realized that it was a bit unfair since the operations team is the one that feels the pain points.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

We already have executed the first steps. I wrote user stories for this app, and planned the sprint with Josh Mejia. We set a mechanism to be able to interact in a more efficient and organized way.

* What will be the next three things you do?

We already did.

1. Gather business requirements.
2. Write user stories.
3. Assign the stories to the spring.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

By seeing that the user stories are completed within the established deadlines.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

1. The app reduces the amount of work that is currently done by the operations team.
2. The operations team is able to interact with the data without problems.
3. The records are updated constantly to reflect the status of our students.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

1. Percentage of stories that were successfully implemented.
2. Average number of clicks that an operations team member has to make to achieve a task.
3. Percentage of students with records updated.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

1. Most of the boring and repetitive tasks are automated.
2. The student records are updated.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

All of them are within reach.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

This is my priority and falls within my responsibilities.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I would need to constantly gather the business needs of the operations team to be able to prioritize the user stories.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I would need the support of the software team so that we can move as fast as possible in the most efficient way. I would also need that the software team supports Josh Mejia's system and leadership.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

Probably the apply and people apps have similar challenges and domains.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Josh Mejia and the software development team.

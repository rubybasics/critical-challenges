# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?
  - We need to unify all our open content under turing.io to drive SEO, student recruitment, and network building.

* Why is this a “challenge”?
  - The content is currently in several different places
  - Some of the content is using technology that will require adjustments

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?
  - Yes.
  - If all resources point back to Turing we are going to be more valuable to other people. This will add to our value as an organization.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?
  - People will continue to use resources connected with Turing but not know it
  - Competition will have an advantage over us

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?
  - I believe strongly that it needs to be done
  - I've had experience improving the online presence of businesses in the past

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?
  - Not sure... nothing??

* Was it effective? How do you know?
  - I don't think so. Even for staff it can be difficult to track all of our online content. Probably even more so for those on the outside to know it's all connected.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?
  - I don't believe so.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?
  - Get content currently on the turingschool github account on turing.io
  - Begin transferring JSL tutorials to Turing's github account
  - Start redirecting old content to turing.io to avoid broken links

* What will be the next three things you do?
  - Find out how to deploy content on github to turing.io
  - Begin deploying that content
  - Establish an effective strategy for transferring JSL content

* How will you keep track of progress and results?
  - Start with a list of resources to move and check them off

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?
  - Yes

## The Future

* What would total success look like?
  - All online content will be accessible through turing.io

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?
  - Google Analytics maybe??
  - Students ability to locate content on turing.io
  - Staff providing links to lessons and content through turing.io

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
  - 3 months: All content on Turing's github account will be accessible on turing.io
  - 6 months: Some content from JSL will be available on turing.io
  - 12 months: All content from JSL will be available on turing.io

* How feasible are each of those goals?
  - It depends how things go on the software side.
  - Goals are achievable but they may be slightly optimistic

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?
  - This challenge is probably secondary right now while I focus on software
  - Hopefully the software team will be self sustaining shortly and I can use time on Fridays to begin this

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?
  - I need to find an effective strategy for deploying content from GitHub to turing.io
  - Learn the best ways to redirect links to old content to avoid broken links

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?
  - Additional labor to make it happen in a timely manner

* Which other challenges does this align with?
  - Marketing challenges

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?
  - Everyone with experience deploying the JSL github content will likely have an opinion about how to improve things

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
  - Not sure

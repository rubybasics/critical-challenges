# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to drive local, state, and national conversations about and policy around developer training to enhance our image as the preeminent developer training program.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

It's been going surprisingly well so far with relatively little intent, but it's of tremendous value to both ends of
our student pipeline.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

It's ongoing, but there's a hump that can be crossed.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We miss an opportunity / damage both student recruitment and job hunting.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I'm doing it already and as ED/founder primarily want to talk to me.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

I got sucked into the White House / TechHire conversation which has bloomed into other opportunities. I've had good
conversations with Dan Pabon and his office. Morris Price from Congresswoman DeGette's office is a friend and has been
in to Turing.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

I can't say that it's lead to anything just yet. It feels like we're building up some awareness and brownie points. But
hopefully soon we'll see them turn into something concrete.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Yes, I've been doing it already.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

First I need to brain dump / organize what conversations have been had and who is involved in each. Maybe it should go
through something like the FatFreeCRM.

* What will be the next three things you do?

It would be ideal to create a strategy for each channel focused on our end goal. Even if we're not ready to make the
request, we can have it in mind for the future.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

I need to figure out those goals first.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

Turing's name is recognized whenever people talk about developer training (bootcamps or higher ed).

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

I'm not sure.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

Within three months we can have the details organized and some concrete goals laid out. Within six months I'd like to see
one major recognition for the program that drives applications and/or jobs. Within 12 months I'd like to see three of those.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

I think they're feasible but if there isn't more direct attention paid they're not going to happen.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

I'm already putting quite a bit of time into it. I really need to be more purposeful about the time, maybe even cut it back.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

None, yet.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I do need to setup some kind of organizational system.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

It's inherently tied into marketing and job-hunt challenges.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

I don't think anyone is in a position to help me internally. Externally Morris, Gordon, the Opportunity@Work folks, and
 Ryan at the OSTP can all help.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

No one can really fill in.

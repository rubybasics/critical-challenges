# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

> What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to enrich the curriculum and student experience with non-critical technologies and ideas.

> Why is this a “challenge”?

Our students come to us to learn the skills they need to become full-time, professional developers. So, it can be hard to encourage them to cultivate skills that aren't obviously related to being a junior developer. That said, it's these very skills that can help them learn the craft of code and ultimately become much better developers than if they just learned the obvious skills.

Also, programming can be fun and it's hard to remember that we're your tailing Heroku logs all day.

> Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

It can totally be solved. On one hand, this is an academic goal. On the other hand, it's also a cultural goal. The value that it brings to the organization is to create a school culture that is passionate about doing and creating interesting things with their skills.

I think it's also super important that our students with skills from their previous careers have an opportunities to leverage their experience.

> What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Turing is a more exciting place to be a student at. I'm sure there are some marketing benefits as well.

> What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

The only skill I have is being super interested in this stuff.

## The Past

> What’s been done so far?

We kicked off the Nodebots meetup. I've been working with some students explore some art and music projects in code. We've done that Ruby Processing lesson a few times.

I've also been running a side hustles elective when possible.

We also bought some more hardware.

We did electives for a while.

> Was it effective? How do you know?

I think it was an initial spike. It's trending positive, but I wouldn't throw the word "effective" around.

> Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

I think Jeff has done a lot with the initial Arduino, Lulzbot, and drone acquisitions. Horace has done a lot with DSA. Josh Mejia has done a good amount with his electives.

## The Present

> What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

* Survey students for interest

> What will be the next three things you do?

* Bring back electives
* Identify students that can lead medium-term projects (e.g. Drew and Morgan with the bathroom sensors)
* Figure out what they need to be successful in their projects

> How will you keep track of progress and results?

I'll probably need a repository. That's how we keep track of things, right?

> Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yup.

## The Future

> What would total success look like?

We'd have at least four projects going on at any time. Students would be passionately interested in them.

> What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

* Posts on the Turing blog
* Non-Turing students attending Community Nights led by interest groups

> What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

I would aim for 1 blog post a month in 3 months and 1 blog post a week in 6-12 months.

> How feasible are each of those goals?

Pretty feasible.

## The Periphery

> What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

That's the hard part of a challenge that focuses on "non-critical" skill areas, right? By definition, all challenges in "critical" skill areas will take precedence.

> What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

This will depend on where the student interest exists.

> What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

* We need to make room in the schedule.
* We may need a budget depending on what projects students are interested in.

> Which other challenges does this align with?

* It would help Daisha build the reputation of the program if we successfully shipped interesting projects.
* I think it would also help Jeff build a community that includes mentors and other friends.

> Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

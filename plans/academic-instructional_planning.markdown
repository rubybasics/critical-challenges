# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

> What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to organize our instructional load and planning to ensure instructors have sufficient time to construct/refine excellent lesson plans.

> Why is this a “challenge”?

Most staff members have multiple responsibilities above and beyond teaching. As a result, lesson planning can sometimes fall to the wayside.

> Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Yes. Ultimately, instruction is the reason we're all here and is the single most important thing that we do here. At Turing, we really emphasize that the quality of our instruction is noticeably hire than some of our competitors.

> What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

If we fail to solve this challenge, then the quality of the instruction at Turing will suffer. Worst, our curriculum can become outdated and contain errors.

> What skills do you have that make you the right people to work on this challenge?

Aside from Jeff, we have the most experience writing curriculum, planning lessons, and delivering instruction.

## The Past

> What’s been done so far?

We went from zero to over 140 lesson plans since August. They're of [varying quality][sad], but—other than new lessons—it's rare that we have a lesson that doesn't have some kind of lesson plan associated with it.

> Was it effective? How do you know?

Yes. As we've brought on new staff or some staff has changed modules, existing lesson plans have formed a foundation for what a lesson should cover.

> Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

It was a challenge shared by everyone.

## The Present

> What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

* Determine what a high-quality lesson plan looks like.
* Take inventory of the current lesson plans.

> What will be the next three things you do?

* Create exemplar lesson plans that meet the highest-quality lesson.
* Create a rubric for categorizing lesson plans.
* Ask instructors to create (or update) on lesson plan that meets the highest-quality standard (focus lesson plans) each week.

> How will you keep track of progress and results?

* We will review a subset of focus lesson plans each week.
* We'll use this information to figure out what we need to do in order to give the support needed to instructors in order to create the best possible lesson plans.

> Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yup.

## The Future

> What would total success look like?

Total success is pretty concrete for this one: if we are successful, we'll have a well-resourced, high-quality lesson plan for every single lesson taught at Turing. Instructors would be responsible for keeping their lessons up to date, but this should only require minor updates (i.e. supporting new versions of Ruby).

Lesson plans would include alternate ways to deliver a lesson and contain links to all of the resources needed to successfully execute the lesson.

> What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

We can use a simple rubric for evaluating lesson plans and then do a count of how many of our lesson plans fall into each tier.

> What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

It's hard to put down an exact number of lesson plans that we'd like to see at a high-quality status in three months until we do our first review, but it's safe to say that if the instructors focus on one each week starting with the 1507 cohort, then we should be able to focus on two lessons in each module every week. Figure there are about six lessons in a week, it should take three passes—especially if Module 4 isn't completely rewritten again.

* We'd like to have the process in place for focusing on specific lessons in place in the next few weeks.
* In three months, the process should be moving along and *most* lessons should be high-quality.
* In six months all of the lessons should be considered high-quality.
* In twelve months we should have lesson plans that include multiple strategies for teaching a given topic.

> How feasible are each of those goals?

* The three month one will be a push, but we think it's achievable in that time frame.
* The 12-month goal is a bit of an aspiration; not every lesson plan warrants multiple approaches.

## The Periphery

> What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?
> What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

We should probably do some research in best practices in lesson writing from the education field as we write our initial specification and rubric.

> What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

None.

> Which other challenges does this align with?

This aligns with the challenge of ensuring high-quality instructional delivery.

> Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

We're going to need all of the instructors to pull this off.

> When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

If Rachel is out, it belongs to Steve. If Steve is out, it belongs to Rachel.

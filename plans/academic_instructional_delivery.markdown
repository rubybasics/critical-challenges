# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

> What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to build the team’s instructional skills/capacity to deliver highly effective lessons on a consistent basis.

> Why is this a “challenge”?

Delivering quality instruction is a base expectation for any educational institution. Doing it at the highest possible quality and on a consistent basis what separates MIT from some degree mill.

> Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Yea. We deliver solid instruction as it is, this challenge is about raising the bar and increasing the consistency. As far as its value: Deliver highly effective lessons on a consistent basis is literally the reason we exist as an organization.

> What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Mediocrity; suppressed student success; probably lower enrollment.

> What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

We both have a significant amount of instructional experience. We have master's degrees in this stuff for whatever that's worth—we are literally masters of education.

## The Past

> What’s been done so far?

Rachel and Steve have sat in a few classes. Instructors have also sat in each others classes. We did a "staff elective" a few months ago where Steve discussed a number of instructional strategies.

> Was it effective? How do you know?

The ball has only just begun to roll on this one. Ultimately, we do deliver some pretty solid instruction, but there is room for growth and we can also improve consistency.

> Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

We suppose it was everyone's individual responsibility.

## The Present

> What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

We are going to continue macro-level observations.

> What will be the next three things you do?

1. We are going to start instructional observations.
2. We are going to draft resources for additional instructional strategies.
3. We are going to improve the quality of our lesson plans (see the related challenge).
4. We are going to start peer observations.
5. We are going to meet with instructors to help improve their planning and delivery.
6. We are going to write up materials on instructional best-practices.

> How will you keep track of progress and results?

* Observation notes
* Lesson plan quality
* Student performance

> Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yup.

## The Future

> What would total success look like?

I'm not sure if there is total success. Ideally, we'll always be able to improve. That said, I think that total success would take the form of student's being eligible (and hired) for positions that no other institution would be able achieve.

> What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

* Student achievement
* Job placement

> What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

Over the next three months, meaningful progress would look like getting the six next steps off the ground.

In six months, we'd like to see increased student performance; actionable feedback from peer reviews.

In twelve months, we'd like to have to rewrite and rethink this entire goal.

> How feasible are each of those goals?

It's going to be tough, but we're tough.

## The Periphery

> What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

Mike took over scheduling from Steve, which opened up a huge amount of bandwidth for him.

> What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

Of all the challenges, this one will probably involve the most research. We're going to have to get some books and whatnot.

> What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Scheduled, weekly meetings between Rachel, Steve, and Jeff.

> Which other challenges does this align with?

This aligns with the lesson planning challenge shared by Steve and Rachel.

> Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Meg is going to come in and work with Rachel and Steve. This is also an all-hands challenge; we'll need the entire instructional staff to help.

> When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

If Steve is out, it belongs to Rachel. If Rachel is out, it belongs to Steve. If—hypothetically—Rachel was in—let's say—Las Vegas and Steve was—let's go with—on paternity leave, then it would belong to Jeff.

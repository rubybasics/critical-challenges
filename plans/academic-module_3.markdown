# Module 3

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

1. We need to increase the proficiencies in Module 3 so students understand how web applications change with scale and interact with each other across APIs.
2. We need to empower students to build meaningful, well-executed solo projects.
3. We need to provide students a solid beginning in JavaScript before they finish Module 3.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

1. Because students need to be able to move onto module 4 knowing how to make their web applications performant.
2. Because our professional definition of a developer is someone who can take a business need a transform it into product. Therefore, their solo projects are a crucial step into doing that.
3. Because to be able to move onto module 4, which is very JavaScript heavy, students need to be able to feel comfortable in JavaScript.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

1. Yes. The value is that students are going to be able to build not only beautiful products, but ones that perform really well in the real world.
2. Yes. This would allow our students to differentiate not only in terms of technical skill, but in terms of project management and business value as well.
3. Yes. Given the increased competition from similar programs and the rise of JavaScript, we need to provide a better JS foundation to our students.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

1. Our students won't be able to contribute in larger scale applications or will need additional time to ramp up before being productive at their new jobs.
2. Our students won't have strong project management skills or wouldn't be able to understand that their value relies heavily on their ability to solve business' problems.
3. Our students would be at a disadvantage when building web apps since JavaScript is the de facto language of the web. Also, other JS focused programs would have an edge over them when applying for jobs.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

1. I have so far taught classes on caching, background workers and APIs in Rails. However, I lack programming experience with large-scale applications.
2. I have experience leading a web development company and a startup, and I have worked with various teams in person and remotely.
3. I have JavaScript understanding but I lack experience on front-end frameworks.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

1. We have included classes in caching, background workers, performance metrics and APIs, introducing a third project (Feed Engine), and including performance in the project rubric.
2. We have project checkins on Tuesdays and Thursdays where we set the priorities following an agile model.
3. We have included more JavaScript, such as jQuery, debugging, JS and Rails, testing JS, and we are experimenting with introducing Angular.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

1. Too soon to know. We expect that with the Feed Engine and the inclusion of the performance metrics in the rubric, students will have an incentive to use them.
2. Yes, students mentioned that their individual project is their highlight at Turing.
3. Too soon to know. Angular classes will happen next week. We also would need to wait until they advance into module 4 so that Steve can check their JS knowledge.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

1. Not really. Before the anchor system, we were all doing it and no one was responsible.
2. Yes, Jeff. I took over when this became part of module 3.
3. No. Steve and I started working on this for the last two modules.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

1. We already have. Adding a third project and adding performance in the rubric.
2. We already have. Adding two checkins per week and switching to agile.
3. We already included this changes in the curriculum for the this last module.

* What will be the next three things you do?

1. Wait to see how the Feed Engine projects go and measure them.
2. I think this is already successful.
3. Continue to improve the JS curriculum and settle on a structure.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

1. We included a metric to do so in the rubric.
2. By the quality of the last projects.
3. By how well their JS is. Maybe including some more in the final assessment of module 3.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

1. Yes, but rotation will make it difficult.
2. Yes.
3. Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

1. Students are able to optimize their web applications, and use APIs with confidence.
2. Students will be able to take a business need and transform it into product in a timely manner.
3. Students will be able to utilize JavaScript and incorporate it in their projects.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

1. Percentage of students that are able to obtain a 3 or more in performance in their final assessment.
2. Percentage of students that are able to demo their individual projects in module 3.
3. Percentage of students that obtain a 3 or more in their final assessment in JS.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

1. 90 per cent or more students are able to obtain a 3 or more in performance in their final assessment.
2. 90 per cent or more students are able to demo their individual projects in module 3.
3. 90 per cent or more students obtain a 3 or more in their final assessment in JS.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

All of them are feasible.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

I will keep working on what I am working since this is part of my responsibilities.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

1. I need to talk to more developers that have production experience.
2. I will like to research and talk to more agile teams to get best practices. Maybe get certified in scrum.
3. I will need to learn more JavaScript and a front-end framework such as Ember, React or Angular.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

1. Attending more conferences.
2. Get more scrum training and maybe a certification.
3. Get books, online materials, and subscriptions to online learning sites such as CodeSchool. Also, time to be able to focus on this.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

1. Steve's and Rachel's.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

1. Maybe some mentors such as Mike Pack, Jay, Sean, etc.

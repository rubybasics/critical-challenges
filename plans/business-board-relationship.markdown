# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to make meaningful use of and have regular contact with our Board of Directors.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

It's an ongoing effort that, so far, has been done poorly.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Can't be solved, but we could evolve some strong patterns.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

It's mostly a missed opportunity. The board could/can be a valuable resource for us. If we fail at this challenge
then they'll be disengaged and maybe drop off.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

The relationship with the board is my responsibility as ED.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

We've had a few meetings and I've sent out a handful, like three, "weekly" emails.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

Every time we reach out to them there's clearly a "bump" in their involvement.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

It's always been mine.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

I will put a reserved time on my calendar to send out a weekly update. (Thursday's 12:00-12:30)

* What will be the next three things you do?

First, I'll try to actually get three of them out in a row. Second, I'd like to get their photos up on the website. And
third I'd like to setup a 30-minute call with each of them every X weeks (one per week).

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

I'm not sure yet.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

Keeping the board updated is fun. Board members are highly participatory in the day to operations of the school. They're
engaged with students, instructors, and alumni.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

The simplest one is "board updates per module". My goal for the next module will be to hit at least 5.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

In three months I can consistently hit 5 of 6 updates per module. Within six months I will have had a 1-on-1 with
each board member. Within 12 months I will have had at least two.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Very feasible.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

My Thursday lunch time was already half-scheduled for Andela work, so consuming the other half isn't a big deal.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I need to get a better feel for what level of detail and what topics they're interested in. This will come with some
experimentation.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I'd love to get some feedback from them. Maybe after two or three updates I can reach out and solicit feedback.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

None.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Heather has a lot of experience with boards. Raissa also contacts ours frequently.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

I'd like Jorge and Rachel to collaborate on updates when I'm not available on Thursdays.

# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to determine the next academic and strategic leaps for Turing.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

We're exiting true "startup mode" and entering a phase of stability. What's our next challenge?

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Yes, we can make a plan and consider the challenge solved (at least for another year).

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Then we're stuck in a loop, doing the same things over and over. That becomes dangerous if our competition is constantly
innovating.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

Long-term idea generation is one of my strengths.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

Not much, really. We knew what we wanted to have at this point before gSchool even ended.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

We made an initial plan and we've actually followed it pretty closely. It worked.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

No.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

Next week I'm going to have some good alone time to think, come up with ideas, and sketch practicalities.

* What will be the next three things you do?

1. Sketch out the structure of a four-module design program
2. Draw up a budget/cashflow projections for the design program
3. Start a place to generate and collect ideas about what we do next

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

"There's a Repo for That" -- I'll put it all in GitHub.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

It'd be amazing to have a month-by-month plan for the next two years.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

Plans can be developed to a quality where they're presented to the board. Also, we could track how many months
there are between now and the end of our strategic plan. It should always stay 12-24 months.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

It's be meaningful to have a concrete idea of what Turing will look like at the close of 2016.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Totally feasible.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

None.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I think I know enough to get started, but will want feedback from the team and design experts along the way.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

Just a bit of writing/thinking time.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

Not much, actually.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

I appreciate Jorge's help on these kinds of things. Ben and Cat in Berlin have been helpful about design. If I get things
to a point where I can tweet about them I'll surely get some feedback.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

Not necessary.

# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

> What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to increase the proficiencies in Module 4 so students are able to create components that work together to provide a single rich experience.

> Why is this a “challenge”?

Module 4 is an interesting beast. On one hand, our students come out of Module 3 with a solid understanding of the basics of building a web application in Rails. On the other hand, they're slightly distracted by the job hunt. We also tend to pivot pretty significantly towards JavaScript—which I think is definitely the next step for them in building rich, web applications.

Module 4 traditionally struggled to figure out what it's all about. I think that this challenge sets a clear direction to for the theme of Module 4.

> Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

Yea, I think it can. We've been iterating towards a better Module 4 each and every time. I don't think we're done yet though and I'd say we're still closer to the beginning than to the end of our improvement of the module. As far as the value to the organization, I'd say it's super important that a good 1/4 of the program be the best it can possibly be.

Given the length of the program, it's also what separates us from many other training programs. Module 4 is an opportunity to create developers who are head and shoulders above graduates of other programs.

> What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

Then we're the worst.

> What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

As it stands, I'm the only one willing to teach Module 4—so, that's helpful. I also have the most experience with teaching Module 4 as well as many of the topics contained in the module.

## The Past

> What’s been done so far?

Module 4 has been re-written a number of times. I'd argue that it's currently in its best iteration yet.

> Was it effective? How do you know?

It was definitely effective, but there is still much more to be done.

> Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

This has always been my challenge. It's really all I know.

## The Present

> What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

Step one is probably executing the current curriculum. It's a happy coincidence that we revised Module 4 in a way that aligned closely with this challenge.

> What will be the next three things you do?

1. Review all of the student feedback from the weeks so far in Module 4.
2. Review all of the projects in the Module in light of this challenge and see if they can be modified to better align to the challenge.
3. Review the sequence and scope of lessons in light of this challenge.

> How will you keep track of progress and results?

1. Weekly surveys
2. Student performance on the final assessment
3. Project quality
4. Individual discussions with students

> Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Totally—barring any module rotation.

## The Future

> What would total success look like?

Total success take the form of students who are as comfortable applying for JavaScript jobs as they are for Ruby jobs.

> What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

* Project quality
* Final assessment performance

> What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

90% of students pass their final assessment.

It's hard to come up with a clear metric for success. My suspicion is that we'll know it when we see it.

> How feasible are each of those goals?

Totally feasible.

## The Periphery

> What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

None.

> What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I should probably sit down and learn React at some point.

> What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I think it would be super helpful if we increased the amount of JavaScript instruction in the earlier modules. We've been doing it and it has definitely made things easier in Module 4. It helps if I'm not teaching them the basics of the language from the ground up.

> Which other challenges does this align with?

I think challenge aligns with the other module-based challenges (and probably not accidentally). It most closely aligns with Jorge (in Module 3) and Rachel (in Module 2).

> Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

It's been helpful to have support from instructors strong in Rails. I could probably teach any of the Ruby and Rails-related topics in Module 4, but it's nice to be able to focus on the JavaScript and Node part.

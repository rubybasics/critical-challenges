# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to build a culture and system of communication that delivers and values feedback within the team, from the team to students, from students to the team, and between students.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

We're doing better at feedback than at any point in the past, but it still doesn't feel like it's at the core of our process.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

No, but it can become second nature.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We're missing opportunities to improve ourselves and our students.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I think I need to set direction on this and let other people run with it.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

We have the weekly surveys, cohort retros, weekly staff retro, intermission week staff retro, and the end-of-course retro.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

Yes, we're getting a decent amount of feedback from students and using that to make changes. On the staff side I think it
helps with information sharing but I don't think we're really shaping behavior/attitudes/culture.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

A few people, especially Rachel, have tried to take on small parts before.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

I'm going to shift my staff 1-on-1s to every other week and set them up for the morning. When I am out the day of a
one-on-one I'll do it over email or Hangout.

* What will be the next three things you do?

Jorge, Steve, and Rachel will similarly setup 1-on-1s with the people who in their part of the organization.

I want to figure out how to integrate feedback between students in a more seamless way. I'd like to discuss with the
directors especially Rachel. It also would be worth talking to Josh M about an app that could be low-friction. Then we'd
need to do some PD (probably during Gear Up) about how to give good feedback.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

By the end of next module I should have had at least two and hopefully three one-on-ones with each staff member.

Also, by the end of the next module we should have at least a prototype student feedback system in place.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

A culture where feedback flows continuously and easily without ego or harm.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

The staff one-on-one rate is a concrete one. I'm not sure about the student metrics yet.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

3 Months: consistent staff 1-on-1s by me and the directors. A prototype student feedback system in place.

6 Months: That plus a reliable, highly utilized student feedback system.

12 Months: Everyone in the community is giving and receiving feedback in a way that accelerates their growth and performance.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Very feasible.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

I was able to change my exercise schedule to better accommodate morning meetings.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I bet Heather has some good ideas on this.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I need the staff to be similarly committed since I can't 1-on-1 by myself.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

None right now.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Heather for staff, the Student Advisory Board for students.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

The directors can continue with their people.

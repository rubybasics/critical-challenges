# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

1. We need the Apply app to offer a clear and error-free path for students to apply.
2. We need to the Apply app to provide metrics and an easy workflow for the operations team.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

1. Our apply app is the first experience that our applicants have with Turing, therefore, it needs to work seamlessly in an elegant way.
2. We need to be able to automate the repetitive and boring tasks so that we can focus more on growing.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

1. Yes. By having a better experience we can increase conversion rates at each stage, and have the best applicants.
2. Yes. If most of the boring tasks are automated, we could focus on more important things. Also, better metrics could help us improve our understanding of the admissions process and our acquisition channels.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

1. We would have less applicants, and therefore, students.
2. We would continue to spend most our time doing busy work and not valuable work.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I lead the operations team, which allows me to gather and understand the business requirements better.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

Josh Mejia and I planned the first biweekly sprint last Friday, and we expect that the system will allow us to gather the business needs, allow the software team to work on it and be able to have a more organized approach to solving our software problems.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

It has been a considerable improvement so far. We will be able to better assess our progress next week Friday.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

Sort of. It was assigned to Sam but I realized that it was a bit unfair since the operations team is the one that feels the pain points.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

We already have executed the first steps. I wrote user stories for this app, and planned the sprint with Josh Mejia. We set a mechanism to be able to interact in a more efficient and organized way.

* What will be the next three things you do?

We already did them.

1. Gather business requirements.
2. Write user stories.
3. Assign the stories to the spring.

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

By seeing that the user stories are completed within the established deadlines.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

1. The app reduces the amount of work that is currently done by the operations team.
2. The operations team is able to interact with the data without problems.
3. The operations team has timely metrics that describe our admissions funnel in an accurate way.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

1. Percentage of applicants that submit their application.
2. Average number of clicks that an operations team member has to make to achieve a task.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

1. Most of the boring and repetitive tasks are automated.
2. Meaningful metrics are implemented.
3. The application process is clear and easy to understand.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

All of them are within reach.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

This is my priority and falls within my responsibilities.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

I would need to constantly gather the business needs of the operations team to be able to prioritize the user stories.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I would need the support of the software team so that we can move as fast as possible in the most efficient way. I would also need that the software team supports Josh Mejia's system and leadership.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

Probably the apply and people apps have similar challenges and domains.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Josh Mejia and the software development team.

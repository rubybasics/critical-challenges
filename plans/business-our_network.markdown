# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?

We need to leverage our existing/growing network of friends, contacts, and alumni to meaningfully impact Turing students.

* Why is this a “challenge”?

Our network is huge for both recruiting new students and helping existing students find jobs.

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?

It can't be solved, the maintenance of the network is ongoing.

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?

We're already losing people out of the network. If we fail to do a better job then we'll have to put extra effort into
recruitment and job placement which could have otherwise been solved problems.

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?

I like talking with people and finding the connections. I've leveraged my network to get this far. I have the strongest
professional network among the staff.

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?

Really nothing purposeful. It's all in my head.

* Was it effective? How do you know?

Yes, it has been effective, but there's surely untapped potential. It's really the only thing that helped Turing get off
the ground. Now as we settle in we need to be more organized.

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?

No.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?

I've setup a CRM, primarily for Marissa, to help organize some of our contacts and flows. I've also assigned a critical
challenge to Marissa to work on building the alumni network.

* What will be the next three things you do?

Things that could/should be done now are:

1. Ensure that we have proper mailing lists for all alumni of all programs
2. Continue to speak at industry conferences and events
3. Brainstorm ways to get more of our alumni engaged

* How will you keep track of progress and results?

It would be interesting to track the percentage of incoming students who come from our network and the percentage of
jobs take which come from our network. Not that a certain percentage is "right", but it'd be interesting to see which
way things trend over time.

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?

Yes.

## The Future

* What would total success look like?

We have a vibrant network helping deliver new students to our front door and to help them find jobs on the back end.

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?

It ties in with both admissions and jobs. On the admissions side we should track where/who students come from and whether
or not accepted students actually enroll. On the jobs side we should track things like what percentage of students are going
to a company where a previous alum works.

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?

The most meaningful progress would be to externalize even some of the process from my head. Documenting things with Marissa
is the key starting point.

* How feasible are each of those goals?

Totally feasible and necessary.

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?

It's difficult information to organize and is difficult to "dump" the knowledge. It's mostly episodic - things come up
and we document the connections.

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?

None, I don't think.

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?

I need Marissa to continue to help me with organizing the data.

* Which other challenges does this align with?

It fits tightly with admissions and job-hunt challenges.

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?

Marissa and Daisha.

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?

The most sensible is Marissa.

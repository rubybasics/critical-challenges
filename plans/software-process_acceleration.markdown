# Critical Challenges Planning

## The Challenge

* What Critical Challenge are you going to work on?
  We need to manage our software projects to accelerate business and academic processes.

* Why is this a “challenge”?
  - Each team member is limited in the amount of time they can spend on software
  - Finding chunks of time long enough to have a meaningful impact
  - Setting up the environment to work on software can eat up limited time

* Can it be solved? What would be value to the organization/team in solving it or working towards a solution?
  - Yes
  - We will be able to accomplish more with less time
  - A seemless application process will present us in a professional way to prospective students
  - Improving the efficiency of our software processes will free up time for staff involved on the business end
  - Those working on software enjoy programming, so happier employees
  - The software team can learn from each other

* What happens if we fail to solve it / improve it?
  - We continue to function but less time can be spent on more important business challenges
  - Eventually the code will break and we will be less prepared to handle those failures

* What skills do you have that make you the right person to work on this challenge?
  - Experience on a software team with refined processes
  - Managed several small teams in the past including for software, design, and construction
  - Trained franchisees how to improve processes while in the construction industry
  - Understanding of how to convert business ideas into working software with minimal direction

## The Past

* What’s been done so far?
  - Jorge and I have sat down and sketched out a rough plan of how we'd like to organize things
    - Two week sprints
    - Jorge will gather the business requirements
    - I will communicate with the rest of the software team the work that needs to be done

* Was it effective? How do you know?
  - Time will tell, but I have a good understanding of what the next steps are and feel good about them

* Was this someone’s challenge before you? Why did they stop doing it or how did we make progress without addressing it?
  - Not sure.

## The Present

* What are the first steps that you’re ready to execute now?
  - Already established an initial plan with Jorge to understand the business side
  - Met with Josh Cheek to get the ball rolling on the software side
  - Began working on the first user story. Once complete, the Apply app should be in a state that the rest of the team can jump in and start to contribute with ease.
  - I need to get the Enroll app to a state that others can jump in and contribute without spending to much time setting up

* What will be the next three things you do?
  - Ship the first story
  - Delegate the next few stories and confirm our system will work
  - Confirm the Enroll app is in a state that other team members can easily contribute

* How will you keep track of progress and results?
  - By the number of stories being completed
  - Feedback from the business side (Jorge)
  - Feedback from the rest of the software team

* Are you empowered to take the actions you think necessary?
  - Yep

## The Future

* What would total success look like?
  - We'd seen an increase in completed applications
  - No one would have complaints about the software side :)
  - Contributing to the software development process will be easy for team members
  - We will automate all menial tasks involved with the application and enrollment process

* What metrics can be used to evaluate results?
  - Seeing if there is an improvement in applicants completing their applications
  - Decreased time spent by the operations team performing tasks related to the application process
  - Decreased time spent by the operations team performing tasks related to managing data and payments for enrolled or graduated students

* What would meaningful progress look like in 3 months? 6 months? 12 months?
  - Software team has a good process and have completed some of the easier tasks
  - Software team is improving code base to be easily understood by all current staff. Begin adding features that help identify trends.
  - Software is easy to maintain for current staff and future staff.

* How feasible are each of those goals?
  - Very feasible as long as we have the time to dedicate

## The Periphery

* What challenges are you going to stop working on to put time into this?
  - Fridays for the most part are dedicated to this

* What research/learning do you need to do to be effective at solving it?
  - I need to understand the current software
  - I need to understand our team and their availability

* What supports do you need to make meaningful progress?
  - I need the business requirements supplied (There is plenty to work on already)
  - I need the support of the software team

* Which other challenges does this align with?
  - All other software related challenges
  - The operations team as well

* Who, inside and outside our community, can help you?
  - Jorge
  - Software team

* When you're unavailable (sick, leave, etc), who does this challenge belong to?
  - Not sure -- haven't thought much about this

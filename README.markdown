# Critical Challenges

## Plan Drafting

1. First, look through the challenge collections in the `challenges` folder and find all those that you own.
2. Open the `planning_template.markdown` in this folder
3. Create individual files for each of your challenges like `plans/academic_module_1.markdown`.
4. Paste the template into each of these new files and complete the questions
5. Push your completed plan up as a PR

## Plan Feedback

Once you've completed your plans, please give feedback to your peers:

1. Find four open plan PRs, ideally from four different people.
2. In each, read the plan and add questions/comments/kudos as appropriate.
3. If you feel the plan is good to go then merge the PR.
